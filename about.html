        <p>Hi there! My name is Laurel Dernbach, I am in the class of 2022 at Dartmouth College, double major in Computer Science and Spanish.</p>
	<p>At Dartmouth, I am involved as a Section Leader(TA) for the Department of Computer Science, Marketing Director and DJ for Dartmouth College Radio, and a member of Panarchy Undergraduate Society.</p>
	<p>When I'm not coding, I love listening to music, making art, and spending time with the people I care about.</p>
	<p>Next summer, I will be interning at Appian as a Software Engineer, and I am so excited to bring my curiosity and tenacity to the workforce in a way that can serve communities outside of my own.</p>
	<p>Check out how I spend my free time on my Instagram below:</p>
