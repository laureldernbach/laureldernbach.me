# Personal Website: laureldernbach.me
This is the first iteration of my personal website! 
Before beginning this project, I had never used HTML or CSS before. 
Front end development has been intriging to me for awhile now, so I had a ton of fun working on this-- it was hard to stop to work on my coursework!
A lot of the code is adapted from some Google search about how to implement design features I wanted, like the buttons, animated logo, and embeded Instagram feed.
In the future, I want to improve this code so it adapts better on mobile, as well as implement some other links and animations.
